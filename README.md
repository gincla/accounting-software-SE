Online SaaS accounting software is expensive. And the ones I've used are terrible. Namely Fortnox, which is an overprice piece of garbage. Worst value I've ever gotten out of any software.

This repo is a collection of accounting software with the aim of finding a usable and affortdable solution for small and tiny companies.

Please contribute, I've only just started my search!
